### Why and how it works?

This is a projec for our Full Stack course.

The assigment was to learn React and make an userinterface for the project 2 application.

The application should be able to do the following:

- Show comments that have been written
- Take inputs for your comment: username, country and message
- Post and delete comments
- Update message in a comment and save the update
  - There should be an indicator beside the timestamp that a comment has been updated'
- Take input for a search
- Search a comment by name
  - The output only comes to your console at this time (19.05.2023)

### View with;

- Render: **_Coming soon_**
- Or you can open file in browser: "~../"
  - You need to start the frontend and backend separately.
